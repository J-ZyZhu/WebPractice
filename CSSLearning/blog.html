<!-- Skint Dad
So when I talk about coming at a niche from a different angle, this example is exactly what I mean. Skint Dad is a site that helps young / new dads save money and be more frugal in their day to day living. There’s also a section on their that shows guys how to make a little more cash on top of their monthly day job wage, which is vital in some cases just to keep your head above water.  A lot of new dads have the added stress of not having their wives’ or girlfriends’ wage coming in each month, due to the temporary career change in being a full time mum of a baby. So having some content around how they can make a few extra “Ps” in their wallet each month, can ease the burden somewhat. -->
<!-- Examples of Tech Blogs
One of my favourite type of Blog is the “tech blog”.  Now this isn’t something new to blog about, as Tech bloggers have been blogging about technology news and gadget reviews in detail online since the beginning of the internet, But because it’s such a vast niche, you could carve out yourself a really good angle within the tech blog sphere. The trick is to have your own take on tech and don’t just follow the trend. One area which hasn’t really been covered specifically is eco tech, so something to think about. Maybe a blog specifically covering tech aimed at becoming more environmentally conscious.

Anyway, here’s a few blogs in the tech niche that I really like and that I feel are doing something different and is thriving when it comes to organic traffic increases and revenue.

<!-- Examples of Making Money Blogs
Like frugal blogs, making money related blogs have become insanely popular since the global economy has declined in recent years. The want for making more money in order to have a “Ok” quality of life, is increasing year on year. Wages are not rising, jobs are becoming less secure and the cost of living is constantly rising. This is why sites like the ones below in this section are becoming more and more popular.

Again, if you come at this niche with a different angle, then potentially you can have a great and successful website on your hands. -->
